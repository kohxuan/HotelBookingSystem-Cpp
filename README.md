# üè® Hotel Booking System
The **Hotel Booking System** is a comprehensive application designed to manage hotel bookings efficiently. This project is implemented in C++ and covers various data structures and algorithms to handle booking operations, including sorting, searching, linked lists, and binary trees.
<br><br>

### ‚ú® Features
#### Sorting and Searching
- **File**: `HotelBookingSystem_SortSearch.cpp`
- Implements sorting and searching functionalities for hotel bookings, allowing sorting by room type, price, and check-in date.

#### Linked List Management
- **File**: `HotelBookingSystem_LinkedList.cpp`
- Utilizes linked lists to manage bookings, providing functionalities to insert, delete, and search bookings efficiently.

#### Binary Tree Management
- **File**: `HotelBookingSystem_Tree.cpp`
- Uses binary trees for booking management, enabling efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of booking data.
